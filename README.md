# Folium Experiment

## Update 26-Feb-21:
1. https://payne.github.io/Folium1/245countries.html is the current output of index.py -- it shows 245 country borders using geojson from https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/


## Start
This started with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnU5qKTfYY&t=69s that shows making a choropleth map using unemployment data.  I changed it to use number of Recursers who are currently at Recurse.com.   The data is far from perfect (e.g. I added two ND people because I've seen them in meetings even though the data is not there).  Some people don't provide a location in the directory and that's (of course) ok.

To view the resulting map visit: https://payne.github.io/Folium1/index.html
